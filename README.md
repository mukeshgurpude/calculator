Calculator ðŸ”¢
===

A simple calculator built with <span title="Javascript">React</span>...

> Calculator is pretty common thing, even google search also comes with calculator if numerical calculations are searched. 
My main goal for this project is to make this a offline Calculator (ultimately a `PWA`).
